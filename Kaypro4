Besides the obvious external differences in look, compared to the other machines -- the black, angular encasement mark it as distinct from off-white plastice aesthetics of the Macs and Amiga models -- the biggest difference in using the Kaypro for me was the use of keyboard shortcuts. I came to computers at the advent of graphical user interfaces (I am pretty sure the first computer in my home was a Macintosh Classic), so I have only encountered command line interfaces when troubleshooting or inputting cheat codes for computer games. Having been acculturated into word processing through Word Perfect and MS Word, I have always had the facility to tinker with my words, moving things around and going back and forth to different sections, so the amount of forethought and planning required to create a document on the Kaypro is challenging to me (or, more likely, I am just not fluent enough in the keyboard commands to do any tinkering). Further, I have never used a computer that requires the kind of floppy disk the Kaypro uses, and it took me 3 tries just to figure out how to insert it! In terms of what this computer can do that my current one cannot, the only thing I can think of is: focus. Unlike some of the other machines in this exercise, this computer seems to be made for doing one task at a time, and while that might be perceived as a drawback, I think of how many apps I have loaded onto my computer or browser to prevent me from over-multitasking and the prospect of using a machine that is explicitly for the purpose of word processing gives me a fleeting feeling of relief.

I would say that the mechanics of actually producing a document on the Kaypro are "harder" than using a contemporary computer, but I think the truth is they are just different. The Kaypro obviously has fewer options for document creation than the other machines we are playing with -- you cannot input or create images, there are no font options, as far as I can tell -- but I have spent enough time agonizing over formatting issues with MS Word to know that more options usually create more opportunities for problems. Further, the main reason I found it challenging to operate was because I am not fluent in the command codes, so it is not a matter of the machine itself being more difficult, but rather my lack of training that produces difficulty.
