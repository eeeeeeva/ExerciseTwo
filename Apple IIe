Though I was initially mystified and deterred by the three separate on buttons and two flexible disk drives, when I finally got the Apple IIe up and running, this computer gave me a greater understanding of why Apple has such die hard, stalwart brand allegiance. It is so encouraging! So fun! So funny! This computer understands luddite technophobia and is here to assuage your fears. Whereas the Kaypro seems obviously designed for a workplace, the Apple IIe is made for the home user, for the family with children, for recreation. The built-in gamification logic and affirmative pedagogy is a completely different approach to user training than the Kaypro, which has the feel of a workplace orientation and handy reference guide, crunching letters and numbers. Even the keyboard tutorial has a built in game (to help a rabbit or a multinational financial corporation -- a moment of Apple effacing its own magnitude and ambitions, or admitting to them?? It is unclear...)! Not only does this computer want you to use it, it wants you to like using it and feel good about yourself when you do. Even though I have seen "Pirates of Silicon Valley," actually using this computer put in even greater perspective the underlying philosophy of, and attendant success for, Apple's integrated product design and marketing. The product sells itself by positioning itself as your kindly teacher, your friend, your playmate. Though I was patently terrible at Sea Dragon, rather than feeling discouraged, I feel myself wanting to play more, wanting to spend more time with my new old friend.
