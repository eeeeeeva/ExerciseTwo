This seems to me like another workplace-oriented machine. I was not surprised by its vintage, but considering its contemporaries -- the Kaypro 4 and the Apple IIe -- I am curious about what niche it might have filled that they did not cover. It seems that the main difference between it and the others of its moment is its small size and potential portability. It can word process, it can crunch numbers, you can store data in the external tape deck, you can print with the external printer. Even the softer programs built in don't seem to be functional or interactive, just aesthetic (one I found had a message of encouragement and a garden of @ symbols, but didn't necessarily *do* anything). But it is also battery powered, which means it can be taken into meetings, or to an interview. I wonder if people were lingering in cafes for hours, working on their novels on their TRS-80 Model 100s in 1983? Unlike the Kaypro, this machine does not have spellcheck, nor as many options for organizing and crafting documents, which implies a different relationship to writing and word processing, one that speaks to me of a world of internal memos and meeting transcripts, rather than the peripatetic novelist or the contemporary "creative class" worker.
