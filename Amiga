The Amiga is another deceptively familiar machine (for me, at least) -- the in-color graphical interface, the dull beige plastic exterior, the disk drive, even the look of the interface spoke to my earliest Mac memories. It actually proved to me to be the most difficult to navigate, despite some immediate similarities to the Macs. While enjoying the slow, metronomic clicks of the startup disk, I spent a full 3 minutes after I turned it on waiting for something else to happen, not realizing that I had to actually input the floppy disks nearby in order to load the operating system. When I finally got something up and running, I was so excited to see that it had "creative" applications, but after noodling around with the music program for a few minutes, I could not actually get anything to produce a sound.

Thinking with these different machines chronologically, this seemed to me to be the first one that was designed to integrate creative activities like drawing and music-making with gaming and work-related activities into a single workspace. My suspicions were confirmed by The Future Was Here, which contextualized my experience under the rubrics of "multimedia" and "mutitasking." Not only did it presume itself to be the machine for all of your different enterprises, much like what we expect from our contemporary computers, but I am struck by the fact that it imagined the user (at least the user of the "Amiga Appetizer" disk) as not just fluent in, but creative across many media.
